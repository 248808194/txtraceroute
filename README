This is how it works:

$ sudo python txtraceroute.py -n 4.2.2.2
01. 0.001s :: 173.203.x.x :: United States, Texas, San Antonio
02. 0.000s :: 98.129.x.x :: United States, Texas, San Antonio
03. 0.001s :: 174.143.x.x :: United States, Texas, San Antonio
04. 0.001s :: 4.59.x.x :: United States
05. 0.002s :: 4.69.x.x :: United States
06. 0.002s :: 4.2.2.2 :: United States

Disabling DNS and GeoIP lookups makes probing much faster.
